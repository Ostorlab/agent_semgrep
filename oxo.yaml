  This repository is an implementation of [OXO Agent](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) for [Opengrep](https://github.com/opengrep/opengrep) by r2c.
  ## Getting Started
  To perform your first scan, simply run the following command:
  ```shell
  oxo scan run --install --agent agent/ostorlab/opengrep file code.c
  ```
  This command will download and install `agent/ostorlab/opengrep` and analyze the file `code.c`.
  For more information, please refer to the [OXO Documentation](https://oxo.ostorlab.co/docs)
  ## Usage
  Agent Opengrep can be installed directly from the oxo agent store or built from this repository.

   ### Install directly from oxo agent store
   ```shell
   oxo agent install agent/ostorlab/opengrep
   ```
  You can then run the agent with the following command:
  ```shell
  oxo scan run --install --agent agent/ostorlab/opengrep file code.c
  ```
  ### Build directly from the repository
   1. To build the Opengrep agent you need to have [oxo](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) installed in your machine.  if you have already installed oxo, you can skip this step.
  ```shell
  pip3 install ostorlab
  ```
   2. Clone this repository.
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Ostorlab/agent_opengrep.git && cd agent_opengrep
  ```
   3. Build the agent image using oxo cli.
   ```shell
   oxo agent build --file=ostorlab.yaml
   ```
   You can pass the optional flag `--organization` to specify your organisation. The organization is empty by default.
   4. Run the agent using on of the following commands:
     * If you did not specify an organization when building the image:
      ```shell
      oxo scan run --agent agent//opengrep file code.c
      ```
     * If you specified an organization when building the image:
      ```shell
      oxo scan run --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/opengrep file code.c
      ```
